# UoB_BC_Day_Planner

# Introduction
For this piece of work i was provided with an HTML file, which wasn't altered at all aside from me including my javascript file in the <body>, and a CSS file - which has been altered throughout the project. The idea was to create a daily planner that displayed the current date, time slots for common working hours which would change colour depending on whether the respective hour had passed, was in the future, or was the current hour. The application had to take any input from the user, save it to local memory and have it persist on the page upon reload. The application also had to wipe the user's local storage at the beginning of a new day.

## Why did I do this?
To create a tool that i could use to better keep track of my time, and encourage productivity throughout the day by planning my days better.
Also, the development of this application helped improve my knlowledge of APIs, jQuery and local storage greatly, whereas before i wasn't too confident in these particular areas.

### What I learnt
I learnt a great deal about jQuery, APIs & local storage and how to use it. Most of the knowledge i gained came in the form of getting to know jQuery better and how to use it effectively.
Methods used to get local storage data was something i was fairly confused about before completing this project, now i feel as though i have a much better grasp of the topic.

#### For the future
I would like to make it more responsive to screen size, i'd also like to change the timeslots so they were smaller denominations of 24 hours as opposed to 60 minutes.
In addition to this, i'd also like to redesign the HTML and CSS to give the planner a different look.
